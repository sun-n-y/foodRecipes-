## Concepts applied but not limited too

- ### vite + react
- ### useState
- ### render components
- ### index css

::: warning

Notes

- typical html pages

  - every request is going back to the server to grab all resources then full page reload happens
  - not the case for SPA, due to client side routing

- single page application (SPA)

  - operates within a single html page
  - content dynamically updated w/o full page reload
  - provides fast interactions, fluid ux, and smooth transitions between different sections of app
  - Ex. **[My Portfolio](https://sunnykp-portfolio.netlify.app/)**

- react router dom library

  - to create multi-page experiences within SPA
  - facilitates navigation (client side routing) in between components
  - manages rendering of specific content based on current url
  - different components and sections can be accessed and updated dynamically

- react query library

  - caches requests to optimize app performance
